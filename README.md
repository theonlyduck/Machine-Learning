# Machine-Learning and Data Science Progress
This is an overview of various machine learning projects I did using Python and my overall progress with mastering the technology.

# Understanding the basics of machine learning
A list of blog posts introducing readers to ML:

# Project A: Predicting Customer Churn
My first functional ML project which is based on an online tutorial. The objective of this project was to gain an understanding and the implementation of various basics steps to predict bank customer churn with Python:

- [Code](https://github.com/theonlyduck/Machine-Learning/blob/master/customer-churn)

# Project B: Understanding Data Visualization via Pandas
After finishing the first project on ML I had the feeling that I needed a deeper understanding of how to visualize data properly. That's what this project is about - playing around with different kinds of charts and figuring out how to use Python's Pandas library:
- dsfs
-sgsd

# Project C: 
With this project I wanted to better understand how to implement, test, and evaluate **multiple algorithms** at the same time.
