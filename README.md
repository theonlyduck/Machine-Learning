# Machine-Learning and Data Science Progress
This is an overview of various machine learning projects I did using Python and my overall progress with mastering the technology.

# Project A: Predicting Customer Churn
My first functional ML project which is based on an online tutorial. The objective of this project was to gain an understanding and the implementation of various basics steps to **predict bank customer churn** with Python (loading libraries, read data, analyze data, train algorithm, predict important features):

- [Code](https://github.com/theonlyduck/Machine-Learning/blob/master/customer-churn)

# Project B: Understanding Data Visualization via Pandas
After finishing the first project on ML I realized that I needed a deeper understanding of how to **visualize data** properly. That's what this project is about - creating various kinds of charts and figuring out how to use the different functions of **Python's Pandas** library:

# Project C: Applying Logistic Regression and Random Forest in Python
In this project I applied **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models for ML to predict outcomes with Machine Learning. In this case, I successfully predicted **XYZ**

# Project D: 
Through this project I learned how to implement, test, and evaluate **multiple ML algorithms** at the same time.
